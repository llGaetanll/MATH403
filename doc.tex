\section{Introduction - Sets and Relations}

\subsection{Sets}

\definition{
	A {\bf Set}. is a well-defined collection of objects called {\it elements}.

	$a \in A$ means ``$A$ is a set, $a$ is an element of a set, and $a$ is in
	$A$.
}

Examples of sets are

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Z$ - The set of all integers, positive, negative, and zero
	\item $\N$ - The set of natural numbers, $0, 1, 2, \dots$. {\bf In this
			      class, $\N$ starts with $1$.}
	\item $\Q$ - The set of rational numbers.
	\item $\R$ - The set of real numbers.
	\item $\C$ - The set of complex numbers.
	\item $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$
	\item $\{a \in \Z | a > 2 \}$. This is a set of integers {\it such that} $a
		      > 2$.
	\item $\varnothing$ - The empty set.
	\item $\text{GLn}(\R)$ - The set of $n \times n$ invertible matrices with real
	      entries. (GL stands for ``General Linear".)
	\item $C(\R)$ - The set of continuous functions $f: \R \to \R$.
\end{itemize}

\definition{
	A set $A$ is a {\bf subset} of a set $B$ if

	\[
		\forall x \in A, x \in B
	\]

	In other words, everything in $A$ is also in $B$. As notation, we can say
	either $A \subseteq B$ or $A \subset B$.

	A {\bf proper} subset is $A \subset B$ but $A \ne B$. Just write $A
		\subsetneq B$.
}

For example, $\N \subseteq \Z \subseteq \Q \subseteq \R \subseteq \C$. And,
importantly, $\varnothing \subseteq A$ for all sets $A$. In other words, the
empty set is a subset of {\it all} sets.

Two sets are equal if $A = B$, or $A \subseteq B$ {\it and} $B \subseteq A$.
This is often how you prove set equality.

\subsubsection{Set Operations}

We have four main operations.

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Union}: $A \cup B = \{x | x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}$.
	\item {\bf Intersection}: $A \cap B = \{ x | x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}$.
	\item {\bf Product}: $A \times B = \{(a, b) | a \in A, b \in B \}$.
	\item {\bf Difference}: $A \setminus B = \{x | x \in A \text{ and } x \not\in B\}$
\end{itemize}

Two sets are {\bf disjoint} if $A \cap B = \varnothing$.

If we're working in a particular {\it universe} $U$ (i.e. all sets are subsets
of the universal set $U$) then the {\it complement} of $A$ is $A^c = \{x | x
	\in U \text{ and } x \not\in A \}$.

\subsection{Relations}

\definition {
	A {\bf relation} between sets $A$ and $B$ is a subset $R \subseteq A \times
		B$.
}

If $(a, b) \in R$, then we say that ``$a$ is related to $b$", or we write
$aRb$, or $a \sim b$.

\example {
	$R \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\} \times \{2, 3, 4\}$. $R = \{(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) \}$
}

\note {
	Relations might not be reflexive! If $(a, b) \in R$, that means $a$ is
	related to $b$, but it might not be the case that $(b, a) \in R$. In other
	words, the reverse may not be true!
}

Another example might be $R \subseteq \R \times \R$, with $R = \{(x, x^3) | x
	\in \R \}$. Oh look! We just rewrote $f(x) = x^3$, so functions are relations.

\definition {
	A {\bf partition} of a set $A$ is a collection of {\it disjoint} subsets
	whose union is $A$.

	Another way to think of this is that any element of $A$ is in one and only
	one of its partitions.
}

An example of this might be the partition

\[
	A = \Z = \{x \in \Z | x < 0 \} \cup \{ 0 \} \cup \{ x \in \Z | x > 0 \}
\]

is a partition of $\Z$ into 3 sets.

Another example might be $A = \R$, subsets are $\{ x \}$ for each $x \in \R$.

Another, maybe more interesting example might be the following.

\example {
Fix $n \in \N$, $n \ge 2$. Let

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\bar 0 = \{x \in \Z | x \text{ is divisible by } n \}$.
	\item $\bar 1 = \{x \in \Z | x - 1 \text{ is divisible by } n \}$.
	\item $\bar 2 = \{x \in \Z | x - 2 \text{ is divisible by } n \}$. On and
	      on until...
	\item $\overline{n - 1} = \{x \in \Z | x - (n - 1) \text{ is divisible by } n
		      \}$.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Claim}: This partitions $\Z$ into in $n$ subsets.

}

\date{Fri. 26 Jan 2024}

Let's go back to relations, which we put aside to talk about partitions.

\definition {
	A relation $A \subseteq A \times A$ is called an {\bf equivalence relation}
	if it satisfies 3 properties

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item {\bf Reflexivity}: $aRA$ for all $a \in A$.
		\item {\bf Symmetry}: $aRb$ if and only if $bRa$.
		\item {\bf Transitivity}: If $aRb$ and $bRc$, then $aRc$.
	\end{enumerate}
}

The key idea is that equivalence relations on $A$ are {\it the same} as
partitions of $A$. What's going on here?

From an equivalence relation: If $b$ is related to $b$, put them in the same
set. Because of symmetry of equivalence relations, order of elements in the
set doesn't matter.

Conversely, given a partition say $aRb \Leftrightarrow bRa$ are in the same
subset.

\note {
	We'll be talking a lot about partitions and equivalence relations in this
	class.
}

Now we move on to the next step in our intro: functions.

\subsection{Functions}

A function $f: A \to B$ is a relation $R_f \subseteq A \times B$ such that,
for all $a \in A$, there is a {\it unique} $b \in B$ such that $aRb$.
Effectively, this means that

\begin{enumerate}
	\item We pass the vertical line test.
	\item The function is defined over its entire domain.
\end{enumerate}

Which are the properties we expect of functions!

\example {
	Let $f: \R \to \R$, with $R_f = \{(x, x^3) | x \in \R \}$. We write $f(a)$
	for the value $b$ where $(a, b) \in R_f$.
}

Given a function $f: A \to B$. We say that

\begin{itemize}
	\item $A$ is the {\it domain}.
	\item $B$ is the {\it codomain}.
	\item The {\it range} is a {\it subset} of the codomain, only where $f$
	      outputs values.
\end{itemize}

The $+$ operation is a function $+: \R \to \R$, also written as $(a, b)
	\mapsto a + b$. The multiplication operation $\times: \R \times \R \to \R$,
also written as $(a, b) \to ab$. These are binary operations, very useful in
Group Theory.

\definition {
	A {\bf binary operation} on a set $A$ is a function $f: A \times A \to A$.
	Its an operation on two inputs that outputs one thing.
}

\note {
	A dot product does not count here! Because the output of the dot
	product does not come from the same set as the input.
}

To do more complicated things in real life (such as $a + b + c$), we must
parenthesize.

\[
	f(a, f(b, c)) \text{ or } f(f(a, b), c)
\]

Of course this doesn't matter for addition in particular, but it might for
other binary operators!

\example {
	Fix $n \ge 2$ and consider $\Z_n = \{\bar 0, \bar 1, \dots, \overline{n - 1}
		\}$ (Note that this is a set of sets!)

	We want to come up with binary operations on this set. We have

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Addition: $+: \Z_n \times \Z_n \to \Z_n$, defined as $(\bar a, \bar
			      b) \mapsto \overline{a + b}$.

		      But this isn't well-defined! For instance, what happens if $a + b$
		      exceeds $n$? To fix this, let's add the following condition:

		      Let $\bar x = \bar y$ if $x, y$ are in the same subset of partitions.
		      (i.e. They have the same remainder mod $n$.)

		      \qna {
			      Is this a well-defined binary operations?
		      }
		      {
			      Yes! But we must check that it doesn't matter how we define our
			      inputs.
		      }

		\item Multiplication: $\times: \Z_n \times \Z_n \to \Z_n$, defined as
		      $(\bar a, \bar b) \mapsto \overline{ab}$
	\end{enumerate}
}

\note {
	We also write $x \equiv y \mod{n} $ if $\bar x = \bar y$.
}

Now we're ready to jump in.

\section{Properties of Operations on R}

We know that $+$ has the following properties

Properties of $+$ on $\R$, and $\times$ on $\R \setminus \{0\}$.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Associativity}: $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$, and similarly for
	      multiplication

	\item {\bf Identity}: $a + 0 = a$, $a \cdot 1 = a$.

	\item {\bf Inverses}: $a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$

	\item {\bf Commutativity}: $a + b = b + a$
\end{enumerate}

\TODO{} do this for multiplication.

\definition {
	We say that a binary operation $p: A \times A \to A$ is {\bf associative} if

	\[
		p(a, p(b, c)) = p(p(a, b), c)
	\]

	for any $a, b, c \in A$. In other words, how we parenthesize doesn't matter.
}

\definition {
	We say that a binary operation $p: A \times A \to A$ has an {\bf identity} if

	\[
		p(a, e) = p(e, a) = a
	\]

	for any $a \in A$.
}

\definition {
	We say that a binary operation $p: A \times A \to A$ has a {\bf inverses} if

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item It has an identity element $e$ (otherwise identity is meaningless!)

		\item
		      \[
			      p(a, b) = p(b, a) = e
		      \]

		      for any $a \in A$ and some $b \in A$.
	\end{enumerate}

	We usually write $b$ as $a^{-1}$.
}

\definition {
	We say that a binary operation $p: A \times A \to A$ is {\bf commutative} if

	\[
		p(a, b) = p(b, a)
	\]

	for any $a, b \in A$.
}

Let's look at properties of $(\Z_n, +)$ and $(\Z_n, \times)$.

$(\Z_n, +)$

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is Associative.
	\item Has an identity: $0$.
	\item Has an inverse: $\overline{(-a)}$ for any $\bar a$.
	\item Is Commutative: We can move elements around.
\end{enumerate}

$(\Z_n, \times)$

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is Associative
	\item Has an identity: $1$.
	\item {\bf Does not} have an inverse! Because $\bar 0$ is still there, we
	      have no inverse.
	\item Is Commutative: We can move elements around. In this case, $\bar a
		      \bar b = \overline{ab} = \overline{ba} = \bar b \bar a$.
\end{enumerate}

\qna {
	If we instead looked at $(\Z_n \setminus \{ 0 \}, \times)$, would there be
	inverses?
}
{
	We've messed the whole thing up! This is not even an binary operation
	anymore. Since we don't have $\bar 0$, what does $\bar 2 + \bar 2$ even mean
	now, if $n = 4$?

	We'll study this more in about a week.
}

Let's look at matrices. $A = \mat_n(\R)$ be the set of $n \times n$ matrices
with real elements, with the binary operation being matrix multiplication.
Let's look at its properties.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Its associative.
	\item It has an identity.
	\item It {\bf does not} have an inverse.
	\item It {\bf is not} commutative.
\end{enumerate}

Now looking at $A = \gl_n(\R)$ be the set of $n \times n$ invertible matrices
with real entries.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Its associative.
	\item It has an identity.
	\item It {\bf does} have an inverses.
	\item It {\bf is not} commutative.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Proposition}

If $p: A \times A \to A$ is a binary operation with two identities $e, f$,
then $e = f$.

	{\bf Proof}

$e = p(e, f) = f$, so $e = f$.


	{\bf Proposition}

If we have two inverses, then they are the same. More formally: if $p(a, b) =
	p(b, a)= e$, and $p(a, c) = p(c, a) = e$, then $b = c$

{\bf Proof}

$p(c, p(a, b)) = p(c, e) = c$, but we could have also done $p(p(c, a), b) =
	p(e, b) = b$, so $b = c$.

\note {
	Homework 1 is due this Thursday at 11:59PM, on Gradescope. Because this is
	the first homework, Gradescope will allow late submissions but just submit
	it on time.
}

Last time, we talked about binary operations and their properties. Now, we are
going to put everything together and talk about Groups!

\section{Groups}

\definition {
	A {\bf Group} is a set $G$ with a binary operation $p: G \times G \to G$
	that

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Is {\it Associative}.
		\item Has an {\it Identity}.
		\item Has {\it Inverses}.
	\end{enumerate}
}

Note that it does {\bf not} have commutatitivity. We'll talk about that
later.

Notation-wise, we write $(G, p)$, or just $G$ if the binary operations is
understood. Additionally, we often write the operation as $a \cdot b$, $a + b$,
or $ab$ instead of $p(a, b)$.

\definition {
  A Group is {\bf Abelian} if the operation is also {\it commutative}.
}

\note {
  Sometimes, we say that a group is {\it closed} under its operation. However
  we don't need this because a binary operation, by definition, is necessarily
  closed.
}

Let's look at some examples.

\example {
  These groups are {\bf Abelian}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $(\R, +)$
    \item $(\Z, +)$
    \item $(\C, +)$
    \item $(\R \setminus \{0\}, \times)$
  \end{enumerate}

  These groups are {\bf Non-Abelian}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $(\gl_n(\R), \times)$. Recall that this is the set of {\it
      non-invertible} $n \times n$ matrices with real entries.
    \item $(\Z_n, +)$. Recall that this was the set of classes of partitions
      modulo $n$.
  \end{enumerate}

  These are {\bf not Groups}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $(\N \cup \{0\}, +)$, has no inverses.
    \item $\mat_n(\R), \times)$, has no inverses.
  \end{enumerate}
}

\definition {
  The {\bf Order} of a group, is the {\it cardinality} of the set $G$, denoted
  $|G|$.
}

\subsection{Cancellation Law}

In a group $G$, if $ab = ac$, then $b = c$.

{\bf Proof}

Since $G$ has inverses, there is an element $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $a a^{-1} =
e$. So,

\begin{align*}
  ab &= ac \\
  a^{-1} (ab) &= a^{-1} (ac) \\
  (a^{-1}a) b &= (a^{-1}a) c \\
  b &= c & \text{Defn of Identity}\\
\end{align*}

Let's look at some more examples.

\subsection{Groups of Matrices}

\example {
  From the groups of matrices, we can also talk about

  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\gl_n(\R)$
    \item $\gl_n(\C)$
    \item $\gl_n(\Q)$
  \end{itemize}

  Which are all groups.

  {\bf Question}: Is $\gl_n(\N)$ a group? What about $\gl_n(\Z)$?
}

Recall that $\gl$ stands for {\it general linear}. There is also the {\it
special linear} group $\sl$. This is the set of general linear matrices with
determinant $1$. Let's look at some examples

\example {
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\sl = \{ A \in \gl_n(\R) | \det(A) = 1\}$

      Recall that $\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)$, so this is closed.
  \end{enumerate}
}

\subsection{Symmetric Groups}

\definition {
  Given the set $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, the group of {\it permutations} of this
  set is the {\bf symmetric group} $S_n$, where the binary operation is {\it
  function composition}.

  A {\bf permutation} is a bijection $\{1, 2, \dots, n\ \to \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.
  A permutation can be described by a list.
}

\example {
  If $n = 3$, we have the permutations

  \[
    \{123, 213, 132, 321, 231, 312 \}
  \]

  We say that $\sigma: \{1, 2, \dots, n\} \to \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ takes an input
  from the set and defines the shuffle.
}

We'll talk more about Symmetric groups later in the semester.

\note {
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The Symmetric group is {\bf Non-Abelian}.
    \item There are $n!$ permutations of $S_n$, so the order of $S_n$ is $|S_n|
      = n!$
    \item Why the Symmetric Group is named as it is is a question for another
      day.
  \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Subgroups}

\definition {
  A {\bf subgroup} is a subset $H$ of a group $(G, p)$ such that:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $H$ is closed under $p$.

      If $a, b \in H$, then $p(a, b) \in H$.

      Note that we {\it need} to explicitly state that a subgroup is closed,
      because $p$ is {\bf not} closed in $H$, but it {\it is} by virtue of the
      values in $H$. However this does not come for free from $p$, unlike with
      $G$ like before.

    \item $H$ has inverses.

      If $a \in H$, then $a^{-1} \in H$.
  \end{enumerate}

  Note that we also have

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf The Identity}, by virtue of $H$ being closed and containing
      inverses.

      \[
        a a^{-1} = e
      \]

    \item {\bf Associativity}, because $(G, p)$ is associative. This property is
      just inherited from $G$.
  \end{enumerate}

  So $(H, p)$ is a group!
}

As notation, we say that $H \le G$ if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.

\example {
  \[
    \sl_n(\R) \le \gl_n(\R) \le \gl_n(\C)
  \]

  Notice the direction of ``subset-ness"!
}

\example {
  \[
    \{\bar 0, \bar 2\} \le (\Z_4, +)
  \]

  Let's check this one.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf Closure}:

      This is small enough that we can check them all.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item $\bar 0 + \bar 0 = \bar 0$
        \item $\bar 0 + \bar 2 = \bar 2$
        \item $\bar 2 + \bar 0 = \bar 2$
        \item $\bar 2 + \bar 2 = \bar 4 = \bar 0$
      \end{itemize}

      Note that we didn't really need to check the middle two, since the group
      is Abelian, and that property is inherited.

    \item {\bf Inverses}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item $\bar 0 + \bar 0 = \bar 0$
        \item $\bar 2 + \bar 2 = \bar 0$
      \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}

  So we have a subgroup!
}

\example {
  If $G$ is a group and $a \in G$ is an element, then

  \[
    H = \{ \dots, a^{-3}, a^{-2}, a^{-1}, e, a^1, a^2, a^3, \dots \}
  \]

  is a subgroup.

  As a note

  \begin{itemize}
    \item $a^{-3} = a^{-1}a^{-1}a^{-1}$
    \item $a^2 = aa$
  \end{itemize}
}

Furthermore, sometimes, $a^n = e$ for some finite $n$. The smallest such $n$ is
called the {\bf order} of $a$.

\example {
  The order of $\bar 2 \in \Z_4$ is $2$.
}

\definition {
  We say that a subgroup $H \le G$ is called {\bf trivial} if $|H| = 1$. Or,

  \[
    H = \{e\}
  \]

  This is a subgroup of {\it every group}.
}

\note {
  $G \le G$ for all groups $G$. In other words, a group is always a subgroup of
  itself.

  We can say that $H < G$ is a {\bf proper} subgroup if $H \le G$ but $H \ne G$
  and, additionally for this class, $H$ is non-trivial.
}

\end{document}
